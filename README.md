Project 1: COVID-19 Vaccination Data Exploration with SQL and Tableau

Introduction:
This project aims to visualize the progress of vaccination program in the US. Data are obtained from Our World in Data, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data wrangling is done with SQL. Various skills are used, including joins, converting Data Types, CTE's, pivot table, windows functions, aggregate functions and case statement. The output is then exported in Excel form and proceed to Tableau for visualization.

Major finding in this project:
- The vaccination rate is obviously higher on the east coast and west coast than middle area.
- Overall, the pandemic situation did fade out after the vaccination programme starts, instead the situation worsen in some states. For example, the infections in Kentucky reach another peak in September this year. 
- The most popular vaccination manufacteris Pifizer, followed by Moderna and Janssen. There is a small proportion of people take the vaccination made by other manufacturers.
